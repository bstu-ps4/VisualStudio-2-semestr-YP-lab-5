Data Reduction
Data reduction techniques are used in order to obtain a new representation
of the data set that is much smaller in volume, but yet produces
the same (or almost the same) analytical results. The most common
reduction strategies are a) data cube aggregation, b) dimensionality reduction,
c) numerocity reduction, and d) discretization and concept hierarchy
generation [Barbara et al., 1997].
2.6 Data Discretization
As already mentioned, data discretization is a strategy for data reduction,
but with particular importance. Discretization methods are applied
both on numeric and categorical data. Specific methods include:
- Discretization methods for numeric data [Kerber, 1992]
- Binning
- Histogram Analysis
- Cluster Analysis
- Entropy-Based Discretization
- Segmentation by natural partitioning
- Discretization methods for categorical data [Han and Fu, 1994]
- Specification of a partial ordering of attributes explicitly at the
schema level by users or experts

- Specification of a portion of a hierarchy by explicit data grouping
- Specification of a set of attributes, but not of their partial ordering
